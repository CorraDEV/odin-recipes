        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            A small potato dough dumpling that is Italian in origin. Cooked in boiling water and served with butter and Parmesan cheese or a variety of sauces,<br>
            gnocchi can also be chilled, sliced, and then fried or baked. Gnocchi are often served as a side dish for meat and poultry.<br>
            There is also a dried version of gnocchi that is made with semolina flour, rather than potatoes.<br>
            The dried version is considered to be a type of pasta that is generally shaped into a form similar to cavatelli pasta.
